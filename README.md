## CO‚ÇÇ Calculation Model

The CO‚ÇÇ production estimation is based on a simplified model that considers:
- Sugar content (primary factor)
- Fermentation time
- Temperature
- Batch volume

The model accounts for:
- Diminishing fermentation rate over time
- Temperature effects on fermentation speed
- Volume effects on fermentation efficiency

### The math..
1. **Basic CO2 Production**:
   Function: `calculate_co2_production(sugar_amount, days, temperature, volume)`
   This function estimates the CO2 production during kombucha fermentation by considering several factors:
   - Sugar Conversion: Sugar is converted into CO2 and ethanol during fermentation, and the function assumes that 46% of the sugar weight is turned into CO2.
   - Temperature: The fermentation rate increases as the temperature rises above 25¬∞C.
   - Time: Fermentation efficiency decreases over time. In the first week, the fermentation is most active, but the rate slows down as sugar is consumed.
   - Volume: Larger batches have slightly less efficient fermentation, so the volume of the batch reduces efficiency as it increases.
   Formula: ùê∂ùëÇ2 produced = sugar amount √ó 0.46 √ó temp factor √ó time factor √ó volume factor

2. **Fermentation Completion Percentage**:
   Function: `estimate_fermentation_completion(sugar_amount, co2_produced)`
   This function estimates the percentage of fermentation completion by comparing the actual CO2 produced against the theoretical maximum CO2 that could be produced from the initial sugar.
   Formula: Completion Percentage = (CO2 produced / Maximum CO2) √ó 100
   where the maximum CO2 is calculated as 46% of the sugar amount.

3. **CO2 Pressure Estimation**:
   Function: `estimate_co2(sugar_content, temp, time_in_days)`
   This function estimates the pressure buildup in a sealed container due to CO2 produced during fermentation. It factors in temperature, time, and sugar content.
   - Temperature Factor: Higher temperatures increase the fermentation rate.
   - Time Factor: As fermentation progresses, the rate slows down.
   - Pressure Conversion: 1 gram of sugar is assumed to produce 0.01 atm of pressure in a typical bottle.
   Formula: CO2 pressure = sugar content √ó temp factor √ó time factor √ó 0.01

These formulas together help to estimate the CO2 production, fermentation progress, and pressure buildup during the kombucha fermentation process.


## Measuring Tools
To effectively track your kombucha fermentation with this application, you'll need the following measuring tools:

- **Digital Scale**: For measuring sugar and other ingredients accurately (precision to 1g)
- **Thermometer**: For monitoring fermentation temperature (range 0-40¬∞C)
- **pH Meter or pH Test Strips**: For measuring acidity (range 2.0-7.0)
- **Refractometer or Hydrometer**: For measuring sugar content (Brix)

## Data Storage
Batch data is stored locally in a JSON file (`kombucha_data.json`). For production use, consider implementing a database backend.

## Future Updates
- **Raspberry Pi Sensor Integration**: Optional support for temperature and pH sensors
- **Machine Learning Integration**: 
  - Train a regression model on past batches to predict best harvest time
  - Use anomaly detection to flag potential contaminations or failed fermentation early
- **Mobile App Integration**: Companion mobile app for notifications and remote monitoring
- **Community Features**: Share recipes and fermentation profiles with other users
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed statistical analysis of fermentation patterns
